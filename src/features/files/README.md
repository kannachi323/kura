# Files

This directory contains Misty's built-in file browser, previews, file operations, and transfer presentation, including colocated tests. Its component entry and workspace code compile into Misty; they have no separate installation or update lifecycle.

From the repository root, run `misty desktop dev` for development or `npm run build:desktop` to build the frontend. Run `misty check tools` for the built-in tool tests.

Shared UI, API adapters, and native services come from this workspace and its root lockfile. See [Built-in Misty tools](https://github.com/misty-org/misty/wiki/Built-in-tools) for the shared build and native-worker lifecycle.
